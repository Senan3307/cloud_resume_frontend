## Purpose:
The frontend repositoryâ€™s primary goal is to present your resume as a single-page web application, often enhanced with additional features like:

- A clean, modern design that highlights your resume content.
- Integration with a backend to store data like visitor counts or form submissions (using cloud services such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, etc.).
- A personalized and interactive experience for visitors.

## Key Files and Directories:
# index.html:

- The main HTML file that structures the content of your resume page. It usually includes sections like personal information, skills, projects, and contact info.
styles.css:

The CSS file for styling the webpage. It controls the layout, color scheme, fonts, and overall appearance of the resume.
app.js:

The JavaScript file that handles the interactive features of the site. This could include fetching data from a cloud backend (like a visitor count) or form handling (e.g., sending contact information to an API).
assets/:

A directory containing images, icons, or other media files used in the frontend. For example, profile pictures, logos, and background images.
/build/ or /dist/:

A directory typically used for the production-ready version of the frontend. After building and bundling your web application, the compiled files are placed here for deployment.
README.md:

A markdown file that explains the purpose of the repository, installation instructions, and how to run or deploy the application.
package.json (if using Node.js):

The configuration file that manages dependencies, scripts, and project details. It specifies the required libraries for bundling, running, and testing the application (e.g., React, Webpack, etc.).
/src/ (if using a framework like React or Angular):

The source directory where you keep all your components and scripts, such as App.js, which forms the main part of the frontend logic. If you're using a framework like React, this is where you'd structure components like header, footer, or contact form.
