# Purpose:
The frontend repositoryâ€™s primary goal is to present the resume as a single-page web application, often enhanced with additional features like:

- A clean, modern design that highlights your resume content.
- Integration with a backend to store data like visitor counts or form submissions (using cloud services such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, etc.).
- A personalized and interactive experience for visitors.

# Key Files and Directories:

## index.html:

- The main HTML file that structures the content of your resume page. It usually includes sections like personal information, skills, projects, and contact info.

## js:

- The JavaScript file that handles the interactive features of the site. This could include fetching data from a cloud backend (like a visitor count)

## images: 

- A directory containing LMU image

## README.md:

- A markdown file that explains the purpose of the repository, installation instructions, and how to run or deploy the application.

## .gitignore 

- The .gitignore file tells Git which files or directories to ignore when tracking changes in a repository. This is important for keeping unnecessary or sensitive files out of version control.
